## SECTION A — HUMAN-READABLE FULL REPORT

    - Start: May 2, 1984 (“From May 2, she was given clobazepam…”)
    - Stop: June 25, 1984 (all drugs stopped)
    - Reintroduced: Yes (“Readministration of vincamine and clobazepam did not interfere with recovery.”)
  - **Vincamine**
    - Taken “for several years”
    - Stopped June 25, 1984; later reintroduced without issue (“Readministration of vincamine…did not interfere with recovery.”)

**Clinical course / symptoms**
- **June 2, 1984:** Itching begins (“On June 2, she started complaining of itching.”)
- **June 24, 1984:** Jaundice noted (“On June 24, she was jaundiced.”)

**Laboratory data at admission (June 25, 1984)**
- **Total bilirubin:** 113 µmol/L (“Serum bilirubin was 113 µmol/liter”)
- **ALT:** 91 U/L (normal 5–45) → **ALT/ULN = 91/45 = 2.02**
- **ALP:** 25 U (normal 2–5) → **ALP/ULN = 25/5 = 5.0**

**Imaging / histology**
- **Ultrasound:** “The liver and biliary tract were normal at ultrasonography.”
- **Liver biopsy:** Acute cholangitis features with bile duct epithelial injury and cholestasis; no granuloma; only scarce necrotic hepatocytes.

**Exclusion of alternative causes (as documented)**

  - AMA negative (“antibodies to mitochondria…absent”)
  - SMA absent; endoplasmic reticulum antibodies absent
  - ANA present 1:100 (“antibody to nuclei, present at 1:100”)—nonspecific; no autoimmune hepatitis workup beyond this reported.
- **Parasitic:**
  - Fascioliasis and echinococcosis serologies negative.
- **Biliary obstruction:**
  - Ultrasound normal; and no evidence of biliary tract disease one year after recovery.
- **Ischemic / shock liver:** Not reported; mild fever only.
- **Alcoholic injury:** Not reported.
- **Metabolic (Wilson/hemochromatosis):** Not reported.

### 2) R-ratio calculation and injury pattern determination

Using admission labs (only explicit ALT and ALP with ULN provided):

- ALT = 91 U/L, ULN = 45 U/L → ALT/ULN = 91/45 = **2.02**
- ALP = 25 U, ULN = 5 U → ALP/ULN = 25/5 = **5.00**

\[
R = \frac{ALT/ULN}{ALP/ULN} = \frac{2.02}{5.00} = 0.404
\]

**R = 0.40 → Cholestatic pattern (R ≤ 2).**

Therefore, I will apply the **RUCAM cholestatic/mixed** scoring table.

---

### 3) RUCAM scoring (cholestatic/mixed) — item-by-item with evidence and rationale

**Suspected agent assessed:** Carbamazepine (most plausible per narrative and exclusion workup).

#### Item 1 — Time to onset from drug start
- Evidence: Carbamazepine started **May 2, 1984**; itching began **June 2**; jaundice **June 24**; admission **June 25**.
- Latency from start to first symptom (itching): ~31 days (≈4.4 weeks).
- Latency from start to jaundice: ~53 days (≈7.5 weeks).
- RUCAM (cholestatic/mixed): onset typically compatible if **5–90 days** after first intake.
- **Score: +2** (compatible time to onset).

#### Item 2 — Course after cessation of drug (dechallenge)
- Evidence: “On the day of admission, all the drugs were interrupted. The clinical manifestations disappeared within two weeks. The liver function tests…returned to normal within three months (Figure 3).”
- For cholestatic/mixed RUCAM, the course is judged mainly by **ALP (or bilirubin) decrease** after stopping, typically looking for a significant fall within 180 days; exact % fall at day 180 or day 30 is not numerically provided here.
- We do have a clear statement of **full normalization within 3 months (~90 days)**, which supports a positive dechallenge, but without serial values the strict “≥50% fall by day X” criterion cannot be directly verified.
- Conservative RUCAM handling with qualitative improvement but without quantified kinetics: **+2** (compatible improvement after withdrawal, but not fully quantifiable).
- **Score: +2**.

#### Item 3 — Risk factors
- Evidence: Age 79 years.
- RUCAM risk factors (cholestatic/mixed): **Age >55 years** is a risk factor (+1). Alcohol use not reported.
- **Score: +1**.

#### Item 4 — Concomitant drugs
- Evidence: Long-term **vincamine**; **clobazepam** started same day as carbamazepine (May 2). All stopped at admission; later “Readministration of vincamine and clobazepam did not interfere with recovery.”
- Interpretation: Concomitant drugs existed and could confound, but **reintroduction of vincamine and clobazepam without recurrence** argues strongly against them as causes in this case report.
- RUCAM approach: if concomitant drugs are present but evidence suggests they are unlikely (no compatible course / negative re-exposure), assign **0** rather than penalizing.
- **Score: 0**.

#### Item 5 — Non-drug causes excluded
- Evidence includes:
  - Viral markers: “HBs antigen, anti-HBs, anti-HBc, and anti-HAV IgM, absent”; “no…argument for viral hepatitis.”
  - Autoimmune markers: AMA/SMA/endoplasmic reticulum antibodies absent; ANA 1:100.
  - Parasites: fascioliasis/echinococcosis serologies negative.
  - Imaging: “liver and biliary tract were normal at ultrasonography.”
  - Follow-up: no biliary tract disease one year after recovery.
- Limitations: HCV/HEV/CMV/EBV not reported; ischemic causes not discussed; alcohol not reported.
- Overall, the report documents a **substantial exclusion workup** for major competing etiologies relevant to cholestasis/obstruction and common viral hepatitis.
- RUCAM (cholestatic/mixed): when alternative causes are reasonably excluded, **+2**.
- **Score: +2**.

#### Item 6 — Known hepatotoxicity of the suspected drug
- Evidence: Paper itself notes carbamazepine has been implicated in liver injury and cites prior cases; title and discussion support recognized hepatotoxic potential (“Carbamazepine has been mainly implicated in two types of liver injury…”).
- RUCAM: reaction is **known and published** for carbamazepine (including cholestatic hepatitis/cholangitis spectrum).
- **Score: +2**.

#### Item 7 — Re-exposure (rechallenge)
- Evidence: No carbamazepine readministration in this patient. Only vincamine and clobazepam were reintroduced.
- RUCAM: rechallenge not done / not reported → **0**.
- **Score: 0**.

### 4) Final RUCAM score and causality category

Total score = (Time to onset + Course + Risk factors + Concomitant drugs + Non-drug causes + Known hepatotoxicity + Rechallenge)

= 2 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 2 + 0 = **9**

**RUCAM category (standard):**
- ≤0 Excluded
- 1–2 Unlikely
- 3–5 Possible
- 6–8 Probable
- >8 Highly probable

**Final category: _Highly probable_ carbamazepine-induced cholestatic liver injury (acute cholangitis phenotype).**

Model reference: **OPENAI_MODEL** (as requested; exact value not provided in the case bundle).
